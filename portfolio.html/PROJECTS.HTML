            <sub>
            This project involves creating a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game <br>using C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

                    <sub>Capture the players' moves and validate them.

                        Game Logic:
                        
                       <li> Initialize Board: Create a 3x3 grid initialized with empty spaces.</li>
                        
                        <li>Display Board: Function to display the current state of the game board.</li>
                        
                        <li>Player Move: Function to capture and validate the player's move.</li>
                        
                        <li>Update Board: Update the board with the player's move.</li>
                        
                        <li>Check Win Condition: Check rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning condition.</li>
                        
                        <li>Check Draw Condition: Determine if the board is full without a winner.</li>
                        
                        <li>Switch Player: Alternate turns between players X and O.</li>
                        
                        <li>Game Loop: Loop through the game logic until a win or draw condition is met.</li>

            <PRE>
Standard Library:
<b>1.#include iostream:</b> For input and output operations.
<b>2.#include vector:</b> For storing and managing the game board.
<b>3.Optional Libraries (for enhancements):</b>
 <b>.#include ctime:</b> For implementing time-based features (e.g., AI move delay).
 <b>.#include cstdlib:</b> For random number generation (if AI is implemented).
